## Library Management System

* This is basically a software which can be used in libraries.
* It helps by fastening the process of renting and returning a book.
* An admin which is almost always the librarian has full control over the database
* The front end is written in HTML and CSS integrated with Bootstrap.
* The database is maintained using the RDBMS MySQL.
* The backend is written in Vanilla Javascript.
* The database keeps track of the library members, all the books in the library along with supplier and publisher details.
* We also keep a log of all the books ever rented in a seperate table which can easily be accessed by the admin.
* This keeps the whole process simple for the admin and fast for the member who is renting a book, which is essential for user satisfaction.
